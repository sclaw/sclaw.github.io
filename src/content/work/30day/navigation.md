Day 7: Navigation | #30DayMapChallenge

Today I took inspiration from another one of my favorite antique maps: A 1936 map of Pan Am flight routes in South America.  The map represents such a fascinating period of aviation history and a time when navigating and traveling were markedly different than today. It would have been fun to just recreate the map, but I chose to go a more personal route.  After graduating college, I did some backpacking around South America.  The map below shows most of the places I visited during that time.  

Funny enough, I liked the antique map before my map-loving days.  Instead, I found it in my seaplane loving days.  I was obsessed with the Pan Am clipper ships and saved this cool route map only to discover years later what a good map it was in its own right.  I've also wanted to document those South America travels for some time now, so today's map double-dipped quite nicely.
