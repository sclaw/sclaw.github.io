Day 12: South America | #30DayMapChallenge

Repeating this style for each of the continents has given me a new appreciation for just how large the Amazon River is.  The next largest is the Congo river at ~60% of the Amazon's drainage area.  This is such an incredible system, and hopefully I can learn more about it more in the coming years.
