Day 3: Polygons | #30DayMapChallenge

Geomorphons are a computer vision approach to identifying landform-scale features in topographic data.  I like to think of the geomorphon as a simplified geomorphic unit, and you can see that in this map.  Paleochannels, flood chutes, and meander cutoffs all pop out to me in this map near North Troy, VT.  I made this geomorphon layer using all whiteboxtools (WBT).  WBT has been a recent addition to my toolset, but Iâ€™ve been pleasantly surprised by the wide array of algorithms @John Lindsay has implemented.
