Day 5: Analog | #30DayMapChallenge

For analog day I have a selection of the physical maps I have around the house.  A UVM CEE professor hosted a get-together last night, and a few of us got to dig through his old map collection tucked away in a storage box.  I like to save images of my favorite maps on a folder on my computer, and I asked the other students if they thought people would ever dig through our files the same way we were digging through this box.  We agreed that there's something different about hard copies.  They have a certain magic to them and feel much more special.  I'm excited to see what other maps I come across and collect in my life.
