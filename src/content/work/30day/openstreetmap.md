Day 15: OpenStreetMap | #30DayMapChallenge

Halfway through this map challenge AND today is GIS day!  One of my favorite things about the GIS community is how strongly they embrace free and open-source projects.  I'm always keeping an eye out for new FOSS tools and data to add to my toolkit, and today I got to play around with some OpenStreetMap (OSM) data.  The team at Stamen Design developed a way to symbolize OSM data to look like a beautiful hand-drawn watercolor (thus making today's challenge a breeze).  I accessed this data through Stadia Maps, who are the current group serving up the Stamen design on tiles.  While Stadia maps isn't completely free, they have a free tier and also provide access to their tile service for personal use.
