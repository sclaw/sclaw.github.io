Day 20: Outdoors | #30DayMapChallenge

Today's map was a special request from the University of Vermont Natural Areas team.  Centennial Woods is an absolute treasure in Burlington and one of my favorite places to take a walk, so I was happy to make this map for them.  Little did I know that there are quite a few other UVM Natural Areas.  These sites are managed by the University and available for recreation, classes, and research.  Many thanks to the UVM Natural Area team for all that you do!
