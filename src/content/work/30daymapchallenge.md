  I've enjoyed seeing some of my favorite cartographers work on this challenge before.
  Now it's time to challenge myself.

Every year since 2019, Topi Tjukanov has released 30 prompts on October 1st.  His challenge?  Use the prompts to make one map each day, every day, for the whole month of November.  This is the [30DayMapChallenge](https://30daymapchallenge.com/).

Cartography has come to me quite recently in life.  I began using GIS software for my first job in 2019, but I fell in love fast.  I love that maps can be art as much as storytelling as much as technical reference.  As I started making my own maps, I found that the blend of creativity, aesthetics, problem solving, and craftiness it requires made hours go by in what felt like minutes.  While I do make some personal maps, the bulk of my map making occurs at work.  Yet despite being for work, loading up a high-resolution hillshade or browsing satellite imagery can still fill me with wonder any day.  

This challenge came across my radar two years ago and I immediately wanted to participate.  I loved seeing the maps that some of my favorite cartographers were putting out.  When November came last year, I wanted to do the challenge, but I feared the time commitment with my coursework and M.S. thesis ramping up.  This year, I still fear the time commitment, but I’ve decided to give myself the challenge.  Each day, for the next 30 days, I will release one map.

Please tag along for the journey!
